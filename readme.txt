== Installation ==

1. Upload `easy-Modal` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add `eModal` class to the object you want to make activate the modal window. Will work on divs, links, list elements and just about anything else.
4. You will also need to add a minimum height and width in the settings. This will be fixed shortly.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The screen changes but my modal never shows. =

This is usually because the width and height are not set. Try checking the settings page in the admin area to see if there is a minimum width and height.

= Does this work with CF7 =

Yes, this will work with any custom form shortcode and uses ajax submit features.

= Is the form styled =

We have only included some basic styling for the modal at this point. We will be adding more features to customize the look and feel of the plugin and modal windows in upcoming versions. For now you can add styles to your themes styles.css or add them to the head via plugin.

== Screenshots ==
